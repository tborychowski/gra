## Roadmap
- if buying more stuff - make sure price shown in cargo is average!
- add distances (in days) and travel cost
- add living cost per day (maybe per city?)



- images for locations (thumbs in the sidebar, big in the main location box)
- history arrows (up, down, right) for prices going up or down)
	- in the "Market" section - showing history (bigger than last time?)
	- in the "Cargo" section - showing whether "paid" price was lower/higher than the current
- maybe icons images for wares?
- possibly map for locations & navigation? with icons for ships?
- cargo progressbar
