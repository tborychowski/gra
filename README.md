## Roadmap
- replace alerts with nice modals, where e.g. buying & selling will show live figures

- images for locations (thumbs in the sidebar, big in the main location box)
- history arrows (up, down, right) for prices going up or down)
	- in the "Market" section - showing history (bigger than last time?)
	- in the "Cargo" section - showing whether "paid" price was lower/higher than the current
- maybe icons images for wares?
- possibly map for locations & navigation? with icons for ships?
- cargo progressbar
- damage progressbar
